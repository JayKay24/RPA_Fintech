# Task 1 Command Line Interface

This is a command line utility to automatically crawl and perform tasks at the website -> https://cloud.eais.go.kr/

In order to speed up the crawl process, I'm skipping downloading images, media, some fonts and texttrack.

## Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of chrome [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

## Installation

1. From the root of this repository, run `cd task1/cmd_line`;
2. `npm install`
3. `npm link`

## Usage

```
$ extract-pdf
```

This will automatically navigate to the website at https://cloud.eais.go.kr/ and perform some actions.
